Save to Pocket (mini), a Chrome extension for https://getpocket.com

I think Pocket is great, but I don't like how their Chrome extension
requires so many permissions.  (It even makes use of those permissions
to e.g. modify the Hacker News page.  I appreciate this can be turned
off via their settings but I'd prefer it didn't even have the
capability.)

This extension is the minimal code to auth into Pocket and save URLs
into it.
